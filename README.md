# Ugly Zodiac: An Exercise in terrible UX

## An apprenticeship project to create a very poor user experience

This app was an afternoon project, there are many problems with the code that could be fixed but it certainly delivers in providing a terrible UX!

The app displays the users start sign but the DOB can only be entered as a randomly generated unix timestamp.<br>
It also has garish headache-inducing UI that makes bad use of colour and flex. The columns are not even a set length so the button often moves after the user clicks.<br>
The image is hideous stable diffision generated 'Dark Fantasy' that clashes awfully with the colours.<br>
Descriptions are Google translations of the sign's characteristics into some assorted languages that I doubt many English speakers, recognise let alone understand.<br>
Overall, if you like horoscopes, this is NOT the place to come (I don't even know if the descriptions are accurate...)<br>

Thanks for looking!
